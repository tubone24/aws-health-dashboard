> Easily check the status of **AWS**

This is a web page where you can check the status of **AWS**.

The official [AWS Service Health Dashboard](https://status.aws.amazon.com/) is difficult to use, so I recreated it using Next.js Vercel.

## Background

The official [AWS Service Health Dashboard](https://status.aws.amazon.com/) has only RSS links, making it a rather difficult web page to use.

Since it is difficult to use, I recreated it with Next.js Vercel.

## Install

### Deploy your own

Deploy the example using [Vercel](https://vercel.com):

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/git/external?repository-url=https://github.com/tubone24/aws-health-dashboard&project-name=aws-health-dashboard&repository-name=aws-health-dashboard)

### Local Run

You can develop while using the hot reload function.

```
npm install

npm run dev
```

### Build

```
npm run build
```

## Test & Lint

You can run test and lint by executing the following command; make sure to run it before Pull Request.

```
npm run test-all
```

Also, this test code uses the jest snapshot, so if there are any changes in the UI.
Please update the snapshot using the command below.

```
npm test -- -u
```

When you open a PR towards the master branch, the CI configured in GitHub Actions will run the automated tests and update the results and test coverage.
