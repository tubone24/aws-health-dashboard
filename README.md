> Easily check the status of AWS

This is a web page where you can check the status of AWS.

The official [AWS Service Health Dashboard](https://status.aws.amazon.com/) is difficult to use, so I recreated it using Next.js Vercel.

## Background

The official [AWS Service Health Dashboard](https://status.aws.amazon.com/) has only RSS links, making it a rather difficult web page to use.

Since it is difficult to use, I recreated it with Next.js Vercel.

## Install

### Deploy your own

Deploy the example using [Vercel](https://vercel.com):

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/git/external?repository-url=https://github.com/tubone24/aws-health-dashboard&project-name=aws-health-dashboard&repository-name=aws-health-dashboard)

npm run dev
```
